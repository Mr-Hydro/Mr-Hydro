👋 Hi, I’m Mikołaj, a university student studying Mechatronics.
👀 I’m interested in embedded systems, particularly exploring new technologies and programming techniques to improve my skills.
🌱 I’m currently focusing on C programming and deepening my understanding of ARM cores in MCU families like STM32 (F4/G4) and NXP i.MX RT1052.
🧩 I’m also developing code for my engineering thesis project.
